# Final-Project
### By: Lucas Ahern

#### Our contractor the U.S. Coast Gaurd has request that we analyize survivial data in the one of the most historic Boat sinking's of all time.
The reason our company was tasked with this analysis was to see who was most likely to survive the tragic accident and see if there were trends in the data.  Our company is tasked with finding who was most likely to survive the tragic boat accident and who was least likely.  

There are many different factors at play within this scenario that all must be analyzed.  The Coast Gaurd wanted to see this information and potentially make cruise saftey regulations off of our analysis of this dataset.  They have provided us with the offical passenger information.  I will attach below.

``` install
[train_clean.csv](https://github.com/LAhern1511/Fianl-Project-/files/10915821/train_clean.csv)
```

In this dataset I will break down survival rates based on many different factors such as Sex, Class, Age, and the price paid for a ticket.
I will try and come to a conclusion on what would make you most likely to survive as well as least likely to survive the sinking of the titanic.


I will be doing all the coding in R for this project and you will need to install ggplot2 in order to run the graphs. 

Below are 3 seperate ways to install ggplot2 from [tidyverse](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

## The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:
``` install
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Alternatively, install just ggplot2:
``` install
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Or the development version from GitHub:
## install.packages("devtools")
``` install
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
```
