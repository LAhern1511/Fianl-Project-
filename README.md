# Fianl-Project
### By: Lucas Ahern

#### In this project I will break down survival data of the titanic.  
I will be using the dataset Train_clean.csv.  Attached below is the dataset

[train_clean.csv](https://github.com/LAhern1511/Fianl-Project-/files/10915821/train_clean.csv)


In this dataset I will break down survival rates based on many different factors such as Sex, Class, Age, and the price paid for a ticket.
I will try and come to a conclusion on what would make you most likely to survive as well as least likely to survive the sinking of the titanic.


I will be doing all the coding in R for this project and you will need to install ggplot2 in order to run the graphs.
